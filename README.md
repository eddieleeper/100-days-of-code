# C19 Motion Tracker
With the current focus on track and trace for the Covid-19 virus I thought I'd try using
ruby motion to create a mobile app that enables tracking of location and proximity alerting.

I've not used [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) or done any iOS development before so thought it a good project for the 100 days of code project.

Will spend at least one hour per day, but not more than two hours per day, so that I can get a sense of what can be built in 100-200 hours.

## Rough phase plan
Phase 1 and Phase 2 are learning/exploratory phases.
What can ruby motion do and how do things work?
### Phase 1 - SPIKE Goal display current location
 - [x] Install ruby motion and run any updates
 - [x] Smoke test the dev environment
 - [x] Write the first test
 - [x] App displays current location
### Phase 2 - SPIKE Store current location
 - [x] App records location every minute
 - [x] Store the locations
 - [ ] Display table of stored times and locations
 - [ ] Look into how to get the app on a real iPhone
 - [ ] Review and assess the progress and draw up the application architecture
 - [ ] Refine/change the architecture and  
### Phase 3
 - [ ] Build a web service to receive location and identifiers from multiple clients
 - [ ] Add feature to select covid level - none, symptoms, confirmed.
### Phase 4
 - [ ] App receives notifications for proximity alerts
### Phase 5
 - [ ] Use bluetooth for proximity alerts
